# Security Framework Mapper Application

<div><p>The mapper application is an attempt to bring together the NIST Cybersecurity Framework with the NIST 800, NIST Risk Management Framework, FedRAMP, and DoD STIGS in a singular pane of glass. The goal is to use the mapping to drive automation in DevSecOps by using the STIGS as the guide to script the control and then automatically include the script where required within the DevSecOps pipelines.</p></div>

<p>This is a work-in-progress and will be expanded to include ISO, Cloud Security Matrix, and MITRE Att&ck Framework.</p>

<div>
<p>The application is written in C# using Visual Studio 2019</p>
<p>MySQL is the database. A frameworks_backup.sql file is included that has all of the data for the frameworks that have been parsed and mapped to date.</p>
